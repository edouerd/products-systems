#### Product, Systems
##### An open syllabus for product designers.

—

### Introduction

“Products, Systems” is a sketch of the emergent and mutant sphere of expertise known as Digital Product Design*. The following hypermedia syllabus will address four questions of this field:

1. What is Digital? (Or, what are our raw materials?)
2. What is Product? (Or, what does it mean to crystalize?)
3. What is Design? (Or, what are the systems at play?)
4. What does the future hold?

Contemporary product design is, for the most part, a broken 'graphics' practice. Designers working in digital contexts are repeating history long-covered by other spheres of knowledge. 'Basic' textual websites are labeled "Brutalist". Two hundred years of industrialized systems designing has been forgotten. Thousands of years of architecture and planning theory are generally ignored.

One may note the examples above as artifacts of a prior time, but even the future is bland. Our tools are ancient, broken, and static. Our institutions are stuck on 'mockups' and 'animation' as baseline elements of defining a product system. Everywhere you look, we're still designing for the constraints of device screens.

Throughout this syllabus–sketch, we'll be exploring methods to envision a futuristic practice.

### Ed. Note

This work is open to continual editing and reinterpretation. We are nestled within a mere ten years of the establishment of a modern product design practice, and it's likely things will change, rapidly.

### Structure, Expectations, and Goals

###### Structure

While the media contained in this syllabus is accessible in any order, the outline structure reflects an intentional progression of learning. 
Follow along, or deviate as you like.

###### Expectations

As you progress along with the readings, consider your individual background. Consider the perspective you bring to the act of creation, and the biases you engender in your work. Consider the implication of interfaces as valves and switches of (political) power.

Where does the power flow?

How are you entrapping your users within systems? How are you freeing them? Does what you build need to exist?

###### Goals

Ideally, you should be leaving this syllabus with more questions, with a deeper capability for introspection into your practice. Ideally, you will be leaving with a greater understanding of histories that can inform your practice.
