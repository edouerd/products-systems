###### An open syllabus for product designers.

—

“Products, Systems” is a sketch of the emergent and mutant sphere of expertise known as Digital Product Design*. The following hypermedia syllabus will address four questions of this field:

1. What is Digital?
2. What is Product?
3. What is Design?
4. What does the future hold?

Contemporary product design is, for the most part, a broken 'graphics' practice. Designers working in digital contexts are repeating history long-covered by other spheres of knowledge. 'Basic' textual websites are labeled "Brutalist". Two hundred years of industrialized systems designing has been forgotten. Thousands of years of architecture and planning theory are generally ignored.

One might note the above as artifacts of a prior time, but even the future is bland. Our tools are ancient, broken, and static. Our institutions are stuck on 'mockups' and 'animation' as baseline elements of defining a product system. Everywhere you look, we're still designing for the constraints of device screens.

Throughout this syllabus–sketch, we'll be exploring methods to envision a futuristic practice.
